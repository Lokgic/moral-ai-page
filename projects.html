Determining the optimal way to match patients and donors is a computationally challenging problem, for which algorithms developed in the AI community are already being used.  The simplest approach is to maximize the number of matches. But what if we were willing to prioritize based on a certain patient attribute, such as age?  Are we willing to prioritize younger patients?  Break ties towards younger patients?  We asked online participants for attributes that they felt comfortable prioritizing on, and asked them comparison queries to assess how much they valued these attributes. We adapted a kidney exchange algorithm to take the results into account and investigated the effects in a simulated exchange.";

The public has a stake in our technological future, which is progressing rapidly with the potential for both positive and negative societal impacts. Technology can tackle legal and social justice issues and be a progressive force for change. However, without intentional and inclusive innovation, technology may further inequity and disparate impacts instead. This is due to the nature of tech culture – a lack of diversity in companies, gaps in technology ownership, the inaccessibility of technical jargon (for consumers and policy makers), and the rapid advance of tech itself. Without a public platform, the tech companies disproportionately affect both innovation and regulation. Further, the current technological landscape often precludes consumer values. Consumers seeking to mindfully engage with technology are presented with single, binary, or unclear options. Our mission is to ensure that all parties have a voice in how we consume, innovate, and regulate our technology. ";
