        that their preferences were largely a function of prior exposure to
        computerized systems making these kinds of decisions and in light of
        this finding, we developed a series of interventions that were aimed at
        encouraging the folk to have a greater preference for AI decision-makers
        in a kidney exchange context in order to both better characterize what
        was at work in forming these preferences and also to attempt to
