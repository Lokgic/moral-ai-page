        Max is currently a Ph. D. student in philosophy at the University of Arizona. He led a project on folk appraisal of AI systems making moral and consequential decisions in a variety of contexts. He found that their preferences were largely a function of prior exposure to computerized systems making these kinds of decisions and in light of this finding, we developed a series of interventions that were aimed at encouraging the folk to have a greater preference for AI decision-makers in a kidney exchange context in order to both better characterize what was at work in forming these preferences and also to attempt to synthesize these preference-guiding facts, beliefs, or dispositions.
