Determining the optimal way to match patients and donors is a computationally challenging problem, for which algorithms developed in the AI community are already being used.  The simplest approach is to maximize the number of matches. But what if we were willing to prioritize based on a certain patient attribute, such as age?  Are we willing to prioritize younger patients?  Break ties towards younger patients?  We asked online participants for attributes that they felt comfortable prioritizing on, and asked them comparison queries to assess how much they valued these attributes. We adapted a kidney exchange algorithm to take the results into account and investigated the effects in a simulated exchange.  See the paper here."
